0.1.1
	*	I finally got around to implementing multiconnection
		support, so this release and probably one or two
		after it will be focused on getting that to be as
		clean as possible. Hopefully by the time this release
		is out enough people will have been testing it that
		it will actually work.

	*	Fixed that dumb bug that makes it ask you how you want
		to send the multiple lines in a paste even if it's only
		one line.

0.1.0
	*	Oops, I fucked up the away mode code that decides which
		messages get shown in away mode. I woke up with 76 messages
		in my away window just because I had a PM window open for
		someone, so it logged all messages that person said, in
		any channel. It is now fixed.

	*	The /names command was buggy and could cause crashes if
		a channel was specified as an argument, not it should
		work fine.
	
	*	Another horrible bug in away mode because the selected
		message index wasn't being reinitialised when away mode
		was set.

	*	Added /alias <alias> <command>, e.g. /alias who names
		So /who will now act like /names. It's a dictionary in
		the rc file, e.g.: ALIASES = { 'who' : 'names' }
	
	*	SHOW_EVENTS in the rc file set to False will stop any
		join/part/quit events being shown in the info bar thing.

0.0.9
	*	Someone requested /ping be implemented as it's apparently
		useful, so it now works (and responds to other ping
		requests).
	
	*	Changed the auto-reconnect delay from 5 seconds to 30 seconds.

	*	Added /umode, I never used it but apparently people do.

	*	Undernet seems to have a completely different setup to nickserv
		and chanserv and stuff so it complicates things somewhat.
		I don't use it personally but I'm fixing things up so it works
		better with undernet. You can now do /pass or /quote pass
		as undernet sometimes requests.
	
	*	An oversight in the escape sequence handling routines meant
		keyboard input could get locked out and it turns out it was
		easier to fix than I thought so that should be fixed now.
		Just keep typing and it should fill the escape char buffer
		and behave normally again.

	*	/quote and /raw do the same thing, for sending raw strings
		to the server. So even if there's something I haven't implemented
		yet you can do it like that, but please email me if you're
		using it all the time for something so I can add a proper
		command in.

	*	Fixed a bug that was preventing PMs in open query windows from being
		logged while in away mode. Also prepended the channel the
		last message was said in to the most recent message line at
		the top of away mode, e.g. #bfirc: <bobf> foo bar baz

	*	Going to the beginning of the input window after typing something
		and pressing tab would crash the client, this is now fixed.

	*	There was a bug that crashed bfirc if a /whois was done on a
		non-existent nick.
0.0.8
	*	First on the list is, I've got rid of that stupid list of
		global variables from the sample rc file, as it's no longer
		necessary (thanks to Python's globals() function that I
		somehow previously misunderstood).
	
	*	In this version I'm also going to try to put in as many of
		the missing event handlers as possible. It seems stupid
		not having things like "nosuchnick" being handled when all
		it requires is raise_error( "No such nick." ), so hopefully
		when I get this release out it'll have a load more, I'll keep
		a list here if I can remember them:
		
		Events handled as of 0.0.8:
			nosuchnick
			topicinfo
			cannotsendtochan
			mode
	
	*	Finally fixed (I hope) a very annoying and stupid bug that made
		the client crash when the long word cache got full; if it breaks
		now there'll be an error rather than a crash, but it should be
		fixed.

	*	I added a new, special input hook called "word" which is called
		whenever you finish typing a word into the input window (i.e.
		when you press space, comma, full stop, etc.). It's different
		to all the other input hooks, though. Its handler will receive
		two arguments: the first is the word that was just typed and
		the second is the active buffer at the time. It also returns
		differently: it returns the new word and a colour, e.g.
			return "foo", COLOURS["input"]
		See README for more details.

0.0.7
	*	0.0.6 can safely be ignored as not really worth looking at.
		It has some cool features but there were some issues that
		weren't looked at that should have been.
	
	*	0.0.7, however, kicks ass. See the README at the bottom
		of the section about the rc file for information about
		implementing hooks. They're pretty powerful; in fact
		I develop bfirc using them now, so I can implement
		completely new features without having to reload the program.
	
	*	Probably a bunch of other stuff has been implemented too
		and probably some new bugs but the hooks stuff really kicks
		ass.
	
	*	The escape sequence handling stuff is shit; I need to take a
		look at it and figure out what's going on and the best way to
		do it (as it's obviously been done a million times before),
		but for now if the keyboard locks out just hit escape and
		everything should be okay again.

0.0.6
	*	Fixed up the shit that deals with escape sequences, e.g.
		C-Del and stuff. It was locking out input before because
		it wasn't handling them all properly but that seems to be
		hacketyhacked now. There's still one left that blocks
		all input and I can't track it down, you can still
		send a sigterm. Great.

	*	New autocomplete that kicks ass by keeping a cache of
		long (at the moment >= 7 chars) words you say that'll
		automatically appear as a preview and you can hit tab
		if you want to autocomplete to it. Bang fucking bang.
	
	*	A couple of things re: appearance; bugs seem to be a bit
		hard to come by at the moment.

0.0.5
	*	Someone was bitching because bfirc didn't use the terminal
		default colours, because he uses gnome-terminal (he's an 
		asshole, coincedentally), so now it uses the default colours,
		whatever that means.

	*	I've finally got around to having the rc file as Python code,
		which means you'll be able to do some pretty cool stuff in the
		future. While at the moment it doesn't make any difference,
		I thought it'd be best to make the move now and get it out of
		the way, since no-one's actually using it yet. ;-)

	*	A very small and largely unnoticeable bug when trying to /quit
		while disconnected has been fixed.

	*	Someone was bitching about autocomplete not working for /commands,
		e.g. /q [Tab] -> /quit, so that has been included now also.
		
	*	Someone else was going on about how WeeChat has some shit that makes
		people's names appear in different colours so you can remember
		who's who easily. I thought it sounded lame but it's included anyway,
		except it's different to WeeChat in that (apparently) WeeChat uses
		a completely random way of choosing the colour, whereas bfirc
		uses a colour generated by hack arithmetic. NICK_COLS=[True|False]
		in rc file.
	
	*	The channel list is now in alphabetical order, instead of the
		incoherent order of the keys of the dictionary that they're
		stored in. The channel activity things on the bottom also
		appear in the same order.
	
	*	When you get a PM from someone who you haven't /open'ed, as well as
		displaying it in the main channel, it now also logs it to the sender's
		log file, so if/when you do /open them the messages will be there too,
		which I think helps for continuity, especially when reading back in
		the logs.

	*	So basically a lot of the hacking I did on this I was high at the time
		and I forgot what I did, but I did a bunch of refactoring so you
		I could do some lame log2html thing which isn't in the dist yet,
		it's pretty shitty anyway. But the input box kicks ass now, all the
		usual shit's there, including C-left, C-right, C-backspace, C-del
		and whatever.

	*	You can also change the colours in the rc file and doing a /loadrc
		will change all the colours on-the-fly (as with all the settings
		in the rc file). How much ass does that kick? The answer is a lot.

0.0.4
	*	I've done a bit of work on the input window class to make it a bit
		more reliable and useable. C-a goes to beginning of line, C-u clears
		from cursor to beginning of line, del works and backspace works better
		now if you're backspacing from somewhere other than the end of the
		line.
	
	*	I noticed a rather unfortunate bug in the URL caching code that
		resulted in a nasty crash because the URL stack wasn't being
		taken care of properly. That's fixed, and you can now press C-e
		to get the URL list up.

	*	I'm trying to get it all working as tightly and stable as possible
		before I start working on the multiple connections branch. So
		hopefully there will be just one more bugfix release (or if I'm lucky
		there won't need to be one ;-) before I get to work on the multiple
		connections. Then, hopefully, once that's done there shouldn't be
		much more work to do apart from general housekeeping and implementing
		a few extra features as I think of them.

0.0.3
	*	Unfortunately the away window was broken if you had more than a
		screen's worth of away messages but I've fixed it up now. It also
		truncates away messages to one line to keep it organised, but you
		can still view them in the context window in full.

	*	Fixed another few bugs and tidied up a little bit, but the main
		focus is on the away mode fixes. The autocomplete thing doesn't
		fuck up anymore if you go through the whole cycle repeatedly.
	
	*	I also just fixed up the resizing routines. They're still shit,
		mainly due to Python's tendency to segfault on some necessary
		curses functions so I've had to take out a few calls, resulting
		in the redraws looking crap sometimes and needing user input
		to get them looking normal again (i.e. switch back and forth
		windows or whatever).
	
	*	And as an extra new feature there's the /urls command which
		pops up a list of the last 10 URLs cached and you hit a number
		and boom it gets sent to your url_action command (see README)
	
	*	Logging is now disabled by default. LOGGING = True in rc file
		to enable it.

0.0.2
	*	So a bunch of people were bitching about not having autocomplete,
		that's in there now, both for /topic and nicks, repeatedly hitting
		tab cycles through. Channel list is now C-f.
	
	*	/loadrc is now "officially supported", stick your settings in and
		reload them (nick= is ignored).
	
	*	/topic now lets you actually set the topic, not just /addtopic
		to add something to the beginning.
	
	*	/url added. bfirc caches the last URL received in a message and
		calling /url will execute in the shell whatever you want, the
		example is: url_action=echo %s | xclip
		Stick that in the rc file. If there's no %s then it's added to the
		end of the command with a space preceding it, e.g. url_action=echo
		will do "echo http://foobar.baz/"
	
	*	/watchwords lets you add words that make the client react as though
		a message had your name in it, i.e. highlight it and put it in your
		away log if /away mode is on.

	*	Numerous bugfixes, generally just forgetting to initialise variables,
		etc. and a bit of housekeeping - channel list no longer blocks, e.g..
		Search still blocks so be careful until I fix that.

0.0.1
	First sort of release, most features are in there except
	multi connection support which is the big one.
